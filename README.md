# User Management System

A simple User Management System built with PHP, MySQL, and JavaScript.

## Custom Additions
I have added the following fields to the system:
- **Profile Image**: Optional image upload (PNG, JPG, JPEG).
- **Gender**: Radio button selection (Male/Female).

## Features
- CRUD Operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Real-time Search
- AJAX-based (No page reloads)
- Validation (Client & Server side)

## Requirements
- **PHP**: 8.0 or higher
- **MySQL**: 8.0 or higher

## Setup
This project is built for a local environment. To run, import `schema.sql` and use XAMPP/WAMP.

1. Import `schema.sql` into your MySQL database.
2. Configure `db.php` with your database credentials (default is root with no password).
3. Open `index.php` in your browser.
